    > e. What is the difference between `git` and `GitHub`?
    
    1. GitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code.
    2. Git is a version control system that intelligently tracks changes in files. Git is particularly useful when you and a group of people are all making changes to the same files at the same time.
    3. When you upload files to GitHub, you'll store them in a "Git repository." This means that when you make changes (or "commits") to your files in GitHub, Git will automatically start to track and manage your changes. However, most people work on their files locally (on their own computer), then continually sync these local changes—and all the related Git data—with the central "remote" repository on GitHub. 

    > f. What does `git diff` do?

    Git diff shows changes between commits, commit and working tree. It's useful for reviewing changes before committing them.

    > g. What is the `main` branch?

    > h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the `main` branch?
